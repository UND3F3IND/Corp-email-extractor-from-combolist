# Corp-email-extractor-from-combolist
Note: This script assumes that each line in the input file contains only one email address in the format "username@domain:pass". If there are multiple email addresses in a single line, the script may not work as expected and would need to be modified accordingly.


This Python script prompts the user to enter the name of an input file and an output file. It reads the input file, extracts unique domains from the lines, and writes them to the output file. The script tracks the number of lines found, time taken, and the number of unique domains saved.
